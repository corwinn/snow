What is it?
===========

This program is being made in the hopes that it one day will become a proper
3D snowfall simulator.


Keyboard keys
=============

 * 'q' - quits the program
 * 'f' - toggle full-screen
 * 'p' - freeze :)


How to build
============

 * *nix: type "make"
 * x86_64-w64-mingw32-clang++: type ". build_it_mingw"
 * "VS": TODO (create dev. env. with "FreeGLUT-3.4.0"; should compile and run as
               expected, but one can't be sure until it does; anyways, wind
               motion and proper animation and look are way higher priority)


Credits
=======

Thanks to:

  * "FreeGLUT-3.4.0" for the, windowing system to "Open GL", bridge.
